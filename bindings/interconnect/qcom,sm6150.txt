Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SM6150 Network-On-Chip interconnect driver binding
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SM6150 interconnect providers support system bandwidth requirements through
RPMh hardware accelerators known as Bus Clock Manager (BCM). The provider is
able to communicate with the BCM through the Resource State Coordinator (RSC)
associated with each execution environment. Provider nodes must point to at
least one RPMh device child node pertaining to their RSC and each provider
can map to multiple RPMh resources.

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
			"qcom,sm6150-aggre1_noc";
			"qcom,sm6150-camnoc_virt";
			"qcom,sm6150-config_noc";
			"qcom,sm6150-dc_noc";
			"qcom,sm6150-gem_noc";
			"qcom,sm6150-ipa_virt";
			"qcom,sm6150-mc_virt";
			"qcom,sm6150-mmss_noc";
			"qcom,sm6150-system_noc";
- #interconnect-cells : should contain 1

Examples:

aggre1_noc: interconnect@1700000 {
	compatible = "qcom,sm6150-aggre1_noc";
	interconnect-cells = <1>;
};
