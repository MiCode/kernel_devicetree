      Definition: A phandle to the wakeup interrupt controller for the SoC.

  Please refer to ../gpio/gpio.txt and ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for
  a general description of GPIO and interrupt bindings.

  Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
  common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
  phrase "pin configuration node".

  The pin configuration nodes act as a container for an arbitrary number of
  subnodes. Each of these subnodes represents some desired configuration for a
  pin, a group, or a list of pins or groups. This configuration can include the
  mux function to select on those pin(s)/group(s), and various pin configuration
  parameters, such as pull-up, drive strength, etc.


  PIN CONFIGURATION NODES:

  The name of each subnode is not important; all subnodes should be enumerated
  and processed purely based on their content.

  Each subnode only affects those parameters that are explicitly listed. In
  other words, a subnode that lists a mux function but no pin configuration
  parameters implies no information about any pin configuration parameters.
  Similarly, a pin subnode that describes a pullup parameter implies no
  information about e.g. the mux function.


  The following generic properties as defined in pinctrl-bindings.txt are valid
  to specify in a pin configuration subnode:

  pins:
        Usage: required
        Value type: <string-array>
        Definition: List of gpio pins affected by the properties specified in
                    this subnode.

        Valid pins:
                  gpio0-gpio227
                  Supports mux, bias and drive-strength

                  sdc1_clk, sdc1_cmd, sdc1_data sdc2_clk, sdc2_cmd,
                  sdc2_data sdc1_rclk
                  Supports bias and drive-strength

  function:
        Usage: required
        Value type: <string>
        Definition: Specify the alternative function to be configured for the
                    specified pins. Functions are only valid for gpio pins.

  bias-disable:
    Usage: optional
    Value type: <none>
    Definition: The specified pins should be configured as no pull.

  bias-pull-down:
    Usage: optional
    Value type: <none>
    Definition: The specified pins should be configured as pull down.

  bias-pull-up:
    Usage: optional
    Value type: <none>
    Definition: The specified pins should be configured as pull up.

  output-high:
    Usage: optional
    Value type: <none>
    Definition: The specified pins are configured in output mode, driven high.
                  Not valid for sdc pins.

  output-low:
    Usage: optional
    Value type: <none>
    Definition: The specified pins are configured in output mode, driven low.
                  Not valid for sdc pins.

  drive-strength:
    Usage: optional
    Value type: <u32>
    Definition: Selects the drive strength for the specified pins, in mA.
    Valid values: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16
