QTI PMIC Glink binding

This binding describes the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. PMIC GLink device. PMIC
Glink handles the communication between different clients (e.g. battery charger,
UCSI PPM) on the Application processor and charger firmware running on the
remote subsystem (e.g. DSP) over Glink channel.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,pmic-glink"

Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/qcom/qcom,glink.txt for
information on rpmsg device ("qcom,pmic_glink_rpmsg" used in the example below)
that needs to be specified under a glink device.

= SUBNODE

Each subnode specifies a client of PMIC Glink device that will be instantiated
after the PMIC Glink device initializes.

= EXAMPLE

= PMIC Glink rpmsg device

&glink_adsp {
	...
	qcom,pmic_glink_rpmsg {
		qcom,glink-channels = "PMIC_RTR_ADSP_APPS";
	};
	...
};

= PMIC Glink device with child subnodes

&soc {
	qcom,pmic_glink {
		compatible = "qcom,pmic-glink";

		qcom,batt_chg {
			compatible = "qcom,battery-charger";
		};

		qcom,ucsi_ppm {
			compatible = "qcom,ucsi-ppm";
		};
	};
};
