Qualcomm Technologies, Inc GLINK SLATECOM transport (glink_slatecom_xprt) binding

This binding describes the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc glink slatecom transport
driver, a slatecom-spi based communication channel for sending data between the
various subsystems in Qualcomm Technologies, Inc platforms.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,glink-slatecom-xprt"

- label:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "slate"

= EXAMPLE

The following example reprsents a glink_slatecom node.

	qcom,glink-slatecom-xprt-slate {
		compatible = "qcom,glink-slatecom-xprt";
		label = "slate";
	};

= AUDIO_CC_IPC_NODE
Each subnode of the glink_slatecom_xprt is a device node exposed to user space
by the audio-cc-ipc driver for sending ipc packets between the ipc clients.
Maximum nodes supported is 2.
- Each node defined should contain following property

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,audio_cc_ipc"

- qcom,glink-channels:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>

- cdev_name:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>

= CC_CODEC_NODE
Audio_cc_ipc nodes can have a cc_codec child node. This node will act as an
interface for proxy codec, to manage the communication to its counter part
through ipc.
- Each node defined should contain following property

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,cc-codec"

= EXAMPLE
The following example represents the audio-cc-ipc node having a codec child node

	audio_ipc1: qcom,audio_cc_ipc1 {
		compatible = "qcom,audio_cc_ipc";
		qcom,glink-channels = "custom_cc_apps";
		qcom,intents = <0x2000 2>;
		reg = <GPR_DOMAIN_ADSP>;
		cdev_name = "nongpr_channel";

		cc_codec: qcom,cc-codec {
			compatible = "qcom, cc-codec";
		};
	};
