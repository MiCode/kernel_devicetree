QCT Gunyah Hypervisor Message Queue Test Driver

The Gunyah Hypervisor Test Driver is used to validate gunyah hypervisor
functionality. It includes test nodes for transferring gunyah message
queue between VMs.

Required properties:
- compatible:	"qcom,gh-msgq-test"
- qcom,label:   The IDs of message queue which are defined in gh_msgq.h
- qcom,primary: qcom,primary is required for the master device.
                The client device should ignore this property.
- affinity:     affinity is required for the client device.
                The property is used to affine msgq to specific CPU ID.

Example:
	Master:
	qcom,test-msgq {
		compatible = "qcom,gh-msgq-test";
		gunyah-label = <4>;
		qcom,primary;
	};

	Client:
	qcom,test-msgq {
		compatible = "qcom,gh-msgq-test";
		gunyah-label = <4>;
		affinity = <0>;
	};
