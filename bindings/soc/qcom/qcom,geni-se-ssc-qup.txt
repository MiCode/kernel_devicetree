SSC-QUP Enabling SSR Support for serial

This binding describes the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Added to support the SSR
feature for SSC QUPV3. Extension to se common driver to process ADSP/LPASS SSR
up/dn notification. Driver will accordingly handles notification & triggers
registered cb apis for serial I2C/SPI/UART.

Required properties:
-qcom,subsys-name: Name as identified by a subsystem
-compatible: should be "qcom,geni-se-ssc-qup"
-clocks: Should contain the ssc qup corex & 2x clocks.
-clock-names: Should be "corex" and "core2x" clocks.

Example:

&qupv3_2{
	qcom,subsys-name = "lpass";
	ssc_qup{
		compatible = "qcom,geni-se-ssc-qup";
		clock-names = "corex", "core2x";

		clocks = <&scc SCC_QUPV3_CORE_CLK>,
			<&scc SCC_QUPV3_2XCORE_CLK>;

		status = "ok";
	};
};
