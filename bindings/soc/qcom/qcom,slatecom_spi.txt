* Slate Coprocessor Communication Driver

slatecom_spi driver provides a set of apis to perform
register, fifo, ahb read and write operations with slate
over spi interface. It also reads slate status and
sends events to the registered clients.

Required properties:
- compatible:	      Must be "qcom,slate-spi"

Optional properties:
- qcom,irq-gpio: IRQ used by the slate to inturrupt MSM.

Example:
	qcom,slate-spi {
		compatible = "qcom,slate-spi";
			compatible = "qcom,slate-spi";
			interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
			/* IRQ from slate */
			qcom,irq-gpio = <&tlmm 104 1>;
		};
