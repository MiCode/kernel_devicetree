* Parade pt touch controller

Please add this description here: The Parade Touch controller is connected to the
host processor via I2C. The controller generates interrupts when the user touches
the panel. The host controller is expected to read the touch coordinates over I2C and
pass the coordinates to the rest of the system.

Required properties:
 - compatible           : should be "parade,pt_i2c_adapter"
 - reg                  : i2c slave address of the device.
 - vdd-supply           : digital voltage power supply needed to power device.
 - avdd-supply          : analog voltage power supply needed to power device.
 - novatek,reset-gpio   : reset gpio.
 - novatek,irq-gpio     : irq gpio.

Example:
        &i2c_1 {
                status = "ok";

                /* Parade device tree node */
                tsc@24 {
                        compatible = "parade,pt_i2c_adapter";
                        reg = <0x24>;
                        status = "ok";

                        vdd-supply = <&L29A>;
                        vcc_i2c-supply = <&L21A>;

                        parade,core {
                                parade,rst_gpio = <&tlmm 71 0x00>;
                                parade,irq_gpio = <&tlmm 80 0x2008>;
                        };
                };
        };
