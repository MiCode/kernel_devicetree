    description: if defined provides VDD power to the sensor.

    description: if defined provides VDD IO power to the sensor.

  vio-min-voltage:
    description: if defined provides VIO minimum voltage to the sensor. If the voltage properties for Vio-min-voltage is not specified in the DT, they will be initialized in the driver’s init function. If these properties are defined in the DT, the driver will use the values provided there. However, if neither the DT nor the driver defines these properties, the sensor driver probe will fail.

  vio-max-voltage:
    description: if defined provides VIO maximum voltage to the sensor. If the voltage properties for Vio-max-voltage is not specified in the DT, they will be initialized in the driver’s init function. If these properties are defined in the DT, the driver will use the values provided there. However, if neither the DT nor the driver defines these properties, the sensor driver probe will fail.

  vdd-min-voltage:
    description: if defined provides VDD minimum voltage to the sensor. If the voltage properties for Vdd-min-voltage is not specified in the DT, they will be initialized in the driver’s init function. If these properties are defined in the DT, the driver will use the values provided there. However, if neither the DT nor the driver defines these properties, the sensor driver probe will fail.
