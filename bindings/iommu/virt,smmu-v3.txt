* Paravirtualized ARM SMMUv3

The Parvirt smmu-v3 driver communicates with the underlying
hypervisor to provide S1 translation context descriptor and
other properties which is set by the client. The backend SMMUv3
driver in hypervisor is supposed to program the SMMUv3 hardware
with the information from the paravirt SMMUv3 driver.

** Paravirt SMMUv3 required properties:

- compatible        : Should include:

			"arm,virt-smmu-v3"


- #iommu-cells      : See the generic IOMMU binding described in
                      devicetree/bindings/pci/pci-iommu.txt
                      for details. For Paravirt SMMUv3, must be 1,
		      with each cell describing a single stream ID.
		      All possible stream IDs which a device may
		      emit must be described.

** Example

	virt_smmuv3: qcom,virt-smmuv3 {
		#iommu-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "arm,virt-smmu-v3";
	};
