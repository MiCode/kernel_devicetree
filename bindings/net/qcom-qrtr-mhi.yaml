description: |
  Configuration properties for the qrtr MHI Transport.
  This configuration is to instantiate a transport for
  IPC Router protocol communication between APPS and
  external modems.

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - qcom,qrtr-mhi
      - qcom,qrtr-mhi-dev

  qcom,dev-id:
    $ref: '/schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32'
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      indicates the dev-id that this transport is for.
      Should be passed into the qrtr core logic to determine
      to match with the dev-id used by the mhi controller.

  qcom,net-id:
    $ref: '/schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32'
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      indicates what subnet this transport belongs to.
      If the dev-id passed above matches the one passed into qrtr
      logic by mhi core, then this net-id is passed into the qrtr
      core logic to determin if forwarding is needed on this endpoint.

  qcom,low-latency:
    type: boolean
    description:
      indicates whether this transport receiving thread needs
      to be set to realtime priority for enhanced performance.

required:
  - compatible

additionalProperties: false

examples:
  #The following example represents the qrtr mhi transport node on
  #a device configured as a pcie endpoint and needs to forward data
  #from the host to a slpi co-processor.
