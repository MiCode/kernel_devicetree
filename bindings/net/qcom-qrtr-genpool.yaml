description: |
  Configuration properties for the QRTR Genpool FIFO Transport. This
  configuration is to instantiate a transport for IPC Router protocol
  communication between Virtual Machine and Digital Signal Processor subsystem.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: qcom,qrtr-genpool

  gen-pool:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Phandle reference to a client which has a dedicated memory region for
      sharing between Virtual Machine and Digital Signal Processor subsystem.

  interrupts:
    description: |
      IRQs for setting up and transferring data from and to an edge.
    items:
      - description: IRQ from an edge to check if FIFO and memory is setup
      - description: IRQ from an edge informing there is data to consume

  mboxes:
    description: |
      List of phandles to mailbox channels used for setting up and transferring
      data from and to an edge.
    items:
      - description: mailbox for signaling an edge that FIFO and memory is setup
      - description: mailbox for signaling an edge there is data to consume
