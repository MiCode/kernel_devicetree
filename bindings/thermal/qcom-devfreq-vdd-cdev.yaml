title: The Document describes the device tree binding for devfreq vdd cooling device

The Devfreq Vdd cooling device, will be used to set minimum
operating level for gfx rail using gpu devfreq interface
during cold thermal condition. This cooling device will be
used with cold temp monitor thermal zone. Whenever cold
temperature triggers, it disables frequencies lower than
the minimum operating level using devfreq opp API's.

Required Parameters:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,devfreq-vdd-cooling-device"

- devfreq:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <devfreq phandle>
	Definition: Phandle to the GPU devfreq. This will register the GPU
		devfreq as a cooling device with thermal framework.

- #cooling-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Must be 2. This is required by of-thermal and refer the doc
		<devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more details.

Example:

	devfreq_vdd_cdev: devfreq-vdd-cdev {
		compatible = "qcom,devfreq-vdd-cooling-device";
		devfreq = <&msm_gpu>;
		#cooling-cells = <2>;
	};
