title: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. BCL Peripheral Device For PMIC version 5

description: |
  Qualcomm Technologies, Inc's PMIC has battery current limiting peripheral,
  which can monitor for high battery current and low battery voltage in the
  hardware. The BCL peripheral driver interacts with the PMIC peripheral using
  the SPMI driver interface. The hardware can take threshold for notifying for
  high battery current or low battery voltage events. This driver works only
  with PMIC version 5, where the same BCL peripheral can be found in multiple
  PMIC's that are used in a device, with limited functionalities. For example,
  one PMIC can have only vbat monitoring, while the other PMIC can have both
  vbat and ibat monitoring. This is a common driver, that can interact
  with the multiple BCL peripherals.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: qcom,bcl-v5
    description: msm battery state of charge device

  reg:
    maxItems: 1
    description: |
      <a b> where 'a' is the starting register address of the PMIC
      peripheral and 'b' is the size of the peripheral address space.

  interrupts:
    minItems: 1
    maxItems: 3
    description: |
      <a b c d> Where,
      'a' is the SLAVE ID of the PMIC,
      'b' is the peripheral ID,
      'c' is the interrupt number in PMIC and
      'd' is the interrupt type.

  interrupt-names:
    minItems: 1
    description: |
      User defined names for the interrupts. These interrupt
      names will be used by the drivers to identify the
      interrupts, instead of specifying the ID's. bcl driver will
      accept these standard interrupts.
    items:
      - const: bcl-lvl0
      - const: bcl-lvl1
      - const: bcl-lvl2

  qcom,pmic7-threshold:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When this flag is defined, the BCL driver will account for
      no bit shift in the threshold registers.
