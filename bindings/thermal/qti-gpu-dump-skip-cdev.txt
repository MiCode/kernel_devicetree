Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. GPU dump skip cooling device

The GPU dump skip cooling device, will be used to set WR_THERMAL_FLAG
region in SDAM which is used by PMIC to disable GFX in SDI path, when
SDI path reset is caused during high temperature. It also sets a SOC
cookie in sys dbg imem region which is used to skip GPU scan dump
collection in SDI path, when SDI path reset is triggered during high
temperature.

Required Parameters:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,gpu-dump-skip-cdev"

- nvmem-cells:
	Usage: required
	Definition: Phandle of the nvmem cell for the PMIC register region which
		stores the PMIC WR thermal flag.

- nvmem-cell-names:
    enum:
		- wr_thermal_flag
		- alarm_log

- #cooling-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Must be 2. This is required by of-thermal and refer the doc
		<devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more details.

Example:

	gpu_dump_skip_cdev: qcom,gpu-dump-skip-cdev {
		compatible = "qcom,gpu-dump-skip-cdev";
		nvmem-cells = <&wr_thermal_flag>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "wr_thermal_flag";
		#cooling-cells = <2>;
	};
