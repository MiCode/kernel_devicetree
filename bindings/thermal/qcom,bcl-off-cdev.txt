Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. BCL OFF cooling device

The BCL OFF cooling device, will be used to disable PMIC bcl.
This cooling device will be called when modem RF calibration
is performed using external power supply.

When external power supply is used for RF calibration, ibat current
can cross the battery specs and can trigger batfet issues. So pmic bcl
should be disabled as it is for protection for battery not external
power supply.


Required Parameters:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,bcl-off"

- reg:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <a b>
	Definition: where 'a' is the starting register address of the PMIC
	peripheral and 'b' is the size of the peripheral address space.

- #cooling-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Must be 2. This is required by of-thermal and refer the doc
		<devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more details.

Example:

	bcl_off: bcl-off {
		compatible = "qcom,bcl-off";
		reg = <0x4700 0x100>;
		#cooling-cells = <2>;
	};
