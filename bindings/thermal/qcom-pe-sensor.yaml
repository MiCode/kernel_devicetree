description: |
  The QTI Policy Engine sensor device will register the policy engine
  recommendation with thermal framework as a sensor. This will enable
  to provide configuration to mitigate cooling devices when a recommendation
  is sent from Policy Engine hardware. The recommendations are mitigation
  levels based on CX operating level.

  There can be multiple Policy Engine hardwares for different rails.
