title: QTI LMH CPU Voltage cooling devices.

maintainers:
  - Nitesh Kumar <quic_nitekuma@quicinc.com>

description: |
 The LMH CPU voltage cooling device will be used to place voltage restriction
 vote on CPU railway during cold thermal condition. This cooling device driver
 will register one cooling device per LLM, which can be used by thermal zone to
 place voltage restriction vote.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: qcom,lmh-cpu-vdd

  reg:
    maxItems: 1
    description: |
     <a b> where 'a' is the starting register address of the LLM
     and 'b' is the size of LLM address space.

  "#cooling-cells":
    const: 2
    description: |
      Must be 2. Needed for of_thermal as cooling device
      identifier. Please refer to <devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more
      details.
