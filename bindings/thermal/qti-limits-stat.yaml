description: |
  The QTI Limits stats driver is used to collect different limits stats.
  It collects CPU average and peak current, CPUs online mask, CPUs Load
  percentage, CPU temperature, BCL levels, PE current, PE thresholds etc..

properties:
  compatible:
    const: qcom,limits-stat

  reg:
    maxItems: 1
    description: |
      <a b> where 'a' is the RDPM PE base register address and
      'b' is the size of the RDPM PE address space.

  reg-names:
    maxItems: 1
    description: |
       user defined names for the register set. These register names
       will be used by the drivers to identify the RDPM PE HW block.

       This contains list of thermal zone sensors those need to be monitored
       as part of limits stat collection.
