Limits stats Driver

Limits stats driver is used to collect stats. It collects CPU average and peak
current, CPUs online mask, CPUs Load percentage, CPU temperature, BCL levels,
PE current, PE thresholds etc..


Properties:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: shall be "qcom,limits-stat"

- reg:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <a b>
	Definition: where 'a' is the starting register address of the RDPM PE
			HW block and 'b' is the size of RDPM PE address space.

- reg-names:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: user defined names for the register set. These
		register names will be used by the drivers to identify the
		RDPM PE HW block.
		"rdpm_pe_mx",
		"rdpm_pe_cx",

-qcom,limits-stat-sensor-names
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: This contains list of sensors which needs to be
		monitored as part of limits stat collection.

Example:

	limits_stat: limits-stat {
		compatible = "qcom,limits-stat";
		reg = <0x637000 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "rdpm_pe_mx";
		qcom,limits-stat-sensor-names = "cpu-0-0",
						"cpu-0-1",
						"cpu-0-2",
						"cpu-0-3",
						"cpu-1-0",
						"cpu-1-1",
						"cpu-1-2",
						"cpu-1-3",
						"gpuss-0",
						"gpuss-1",
						"nspss-0";
						"nspss-1";
						"nspss-2";
	};
