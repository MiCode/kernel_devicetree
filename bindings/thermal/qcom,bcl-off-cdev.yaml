description: |
 The BCL OFF cooling device, will be used to disable PMIC bcl.
 This cooling device will be called when modem RF calibration
 is performed using external power supply.

 When external power supply is used for RF calibration, ibat current
 can cross the battery specs and can trigger batfet issues. So pmic bcl
 should be disabled as it is for protection for battery not external
 power supply.
