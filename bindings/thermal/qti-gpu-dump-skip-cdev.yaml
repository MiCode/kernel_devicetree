description: |
  The GPU dump skip cooling device, will be used to set WR_THERMAL_FLAG
  region in SDAM which is used by PMIC to disable GFX in SDI path, when
  SDI path reset is caused during high temperature. It also sets a SOC
  cookie in sys dbg imem region which is used to skip GPU scan dump
  collection in SDI path, when SDI path reset is triggered during high
  temperature.
