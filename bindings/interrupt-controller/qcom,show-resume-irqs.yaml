title: Show Resume IRQs from interrupt controller

description: |
  Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SoCs can be interrupted in order to come out
  of low power modes, knowing the wake up source allows debugging of
  unnecessary wake up interrupts that may bring the SoC out of its low power
  mode. Driver reads GIC registers to determine the interrupt which triggered
  just before the resume loop unrolls.
