Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. eUSB2 M31 USB HSPHY

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "qcom,usb-m31-eusb2-phy"
 - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
   Required regs are:
	"eusb2_phy_base" : the base register for the PHY
	"eud_detect_reg" : VIOCTL_EUD_DETECT register

 - <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
   Required "supply-name" examples are:
	"vdd" : vdd supply for HSPHY digital circuit operation
	"vdda12" : 1.2v supply for HSPHY
 - clocks: a list of phandles to the PHY clocks. Use as per
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
   Required clocks are:
	"ref_clk_src" : the XO clock for eusb2_phy
	"ref_clk"     : the repeater/receiver(abstracted as clock)

 - clock-names: Names of the clocks in 1-1 correspondence with the "clocks"
   property. "ref_clk_src" & "ref_clk" are mandatory clocks.
 - qcom,vdd-voltage-level: This property must be a list of three integer
   values (no, min, max) where each value represents either a voltage in
   microvolts or a value corresponding to voltage corner.
 - resets: reset specifier pair consists of phandle for the reset controller
   and reset lines used by this controller.
 - reset-names: reset signal name strings sorted in the same order as the resets
   property.
 - usb-repeater: phandle to eUSB2 repeater which is used with eUSB2 HSPHY for USB
   functionality.
 - reg-names: Names of the registers in 1-1 correspondence with "reg".

Optional properties:
 - qcom,param-override-seq: parameter override sequence with value, reg offset
   pair.
 - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
   Optional regs are:
        "eud_enable_reg" : register address to read eud enable/disable status.
 - dummy-supply: phandle to eUSB2 repeater for enforcing probe ordering for
   eUSB2 repeater and eUSB2 PHY driver.

Example:
	hsphy@88e3000 {
		compatible = "qcom,usb-m31-eusb2-phy";
		reg = <0x88e3000 0x154>;
		reg-names = "eusb2_phy_base";
		vdd-supply = <&pm8841_s2_corner>;
		vdda12-supply = <&pm8941_l6>;
		qcom,vdd-voltage-level = <0 880000 880000>;
		qcom,param-override-seq = <0x43 0x70>;
		usb-repeater= <&pm8550b_eusb2_repeater>;
		clocks = <&rpmhcc RPMH_CXO_PAD_CLK>,
			<&tcsrcc TCSR_USB2_CLKREF_EN>;
		clock-names = "ref_clk_src", "ref_clk";
		resets = <&gcc GCC_QUSB2PHY_PRIM_BCR>;
		reset-names = "phy_reset";
	};
