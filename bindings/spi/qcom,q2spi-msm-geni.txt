GENI based Qualcomm Universal Peripheral (QUP) Qualcomm Host-Client 2-Way Transport (Q2SPI)

Description: The QUPv3 controller allows Q2SPI protocol communication in single,
or quad wire transmission modes for read/write access to Q2SPI slave.

The QUP v3 core is a GENI based AHB slave that provides a common data path
(an output FIFO and an input FIFO for Qualcomm xSPI) Host-Client 2-way Transport (Q2SPI)
mini-core.

Q2SPI in master mode supports up to 100MHz, up to four chip selects, programmable
data path from 4 bits to 32 bits and numerous protocol variants.

Required properties:
- compatible:			Must contain "qcom,q2spi-msm-geni".
- reg:					Must contain Q2SPI register location and length.
- #address-cells:		Must be <1> to define a chip select address on
						the Q2SPI bus.
- #size-cells:			Must be <0>.
- interrupts:			Must contain Q2SPI controller interrupts.
- clock-names:			Must contain "se".
- clocks:				Serial engine core clock needed by the device.
- interconnects:		Phandles to the	interconnect paths.
- interconnect-names:	List of interconnect path name strings,
						property should contain "qup-core", "qup-config", "qup-memory"
- pinctrl-names:		Property should contain "default" and "sleep" for the
						pin configurations during the usecase and during idle.
- pinctrl-x:			phandle to the default/sleep pin configurations.
- q2spi-max-frequency: 	Specifies maximum SPI clock frequency, Units - Hz.

Q2SPI Controller nodes must be child of GENI based Qualcomm Universal
Peripharal. Please refer GENI based QUP wrapper controller node bindings
described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/qcom/qcom,geni-se.yaml.
Please refer GSI DMA properties described in bindings/dma/qcom_gpi.txt
