I2c Slave: Qualcomm Technologies Inc Universal Peripheral.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be: "qcom,i2c-slave".
 - reg: Should contain base register address and length.
 - interrupts: Should contain I2C slave interrupt.
 - clocks: AHB clock and XO clocks needed by the device.
 - pinctrl-names/pinctrl-0/1: The GPIOs assigned to this core. The names
   should be "active" and "sleep" for the pin confuguration when core is active
   or when entering sleep state.

Optional property:

Child nodes should conform to i2c bus binding.

Example:

i2c_slave{
        compatible = "qcom,i2c-slave";
        reg = <0x088ca000 0x64>;
        interrupt-names = "smbus_alert";
        interrupts = <GIC_SPI 535 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
        clock-names = "sm_bus_xo_clk", "sm_bus_ahb_clk";
        clocks = <&gcc GCC_SM_BUS_XO_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_SM_BUS_AHB_CLK>;
        pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
        pinctrl-0 = <&i2c_slave_sda_active>, <&i2c_slave_scl_active>;
        pinctrl-1 = <&i2c_slave_sleep>;
        status = "ok";
};
