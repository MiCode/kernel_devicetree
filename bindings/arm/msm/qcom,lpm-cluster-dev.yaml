title: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Low Power Management Cluster Device

description: |
  The application processor can do a variety of cluster level low power modes.
  It does so by predicting the low power mode based on latency and residency
  information of various CPUs and clusters.

  To make cluster low power mode decision, cluster device use the different prediction
  algorithms so that chosen the particular low power mode more efficiently.
