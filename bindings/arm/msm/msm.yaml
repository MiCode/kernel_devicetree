description: |
  MSM uses a combination of DTS and DTSI files to describe the hardware on various
  SoCs and boards. Typically, a SoC-specific DTSI file describes the devices
  present on a given SoC, and a board-specific DTSI file describes the devices
  external to the SoC, although some targets may follow a more simplified
  approach. Additionally, the SoC-specific DTSI files may further consist of a
  base chip-specific file and a version-specific DTSI file, to facilitate reuse
  of device definitions among multiple revisions of the same SoC.
