description: |+
  Watchdog timer is configured with a bark and a bite time.
  If the watchdog is not "pet" at regular intervals, the system
  is assumed to have become non responsive and needs to be reset.
  A warning in the form of a bark timeout leads to a bark interrupt
  and a kernel panic. If the watchdog timer is still not reset,
  a bite timeout occurs, which leads to a reset of the VM via
  the hypervisor. The driver needs the petting time, and the bark
  timeout to be programmed into the watchdog, as well as the bark irq.

  The device tree parameters for the watchdog are:

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - qcom,gh-watchdog
      - qcom,hh-watchdog

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 1
    description: |
      should contain the bark irq number

required:
  - compatible
  - interrupts

additionalProperties: false

example:
  - |
    wdog_gh: qcom,wdt_gh {
		    compatible = "qcom,gh-watchdog";
		    interrupts = <0 0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	    };
...
