title: SMMU Proxy Driver binding

description: |+
  The SMMU proxy driver allows DMA-BUFs on HLOS to be lent to the TVM and mapped
  into an S1 context bank of the client's choosing on the TVM. The IOVA of the
  mapped DMA-BUF is sent back to HLOS, which the client then passes to their
  hardware as they did before.

  The driver is split between HLOS and the TVM. Communication between the two
  sides is facilitated by a message queue, such that the TVM has a single
  message handling thread. The proxy driver directly manages the context banks
  of the client devices, as there is no client code to manage the mappings
  of the devices on the TVM.
