description: |+
  Watchdog timer is configured with a bark and a bite time.
  If the watchdog is not "pet" at regular intervals, the system
  is assumed to have become non responsive and needs to be reset.
  A warning in the form of a bark timeout leads to a bark interrupt
  and a kernel panic. If the watchdog timer is still not reset,
  a bite timeout occurs, which is an interrupt in the secure mode,
  which leads to a reset of the SOC via the secure watchdog. The
  driver needs the petting time, and the bark timeout to be programmed
  into the watchdog, as well as the bark and bite irqs.

  The device tree parameters for the watchdog are:

properties:
  compatible:
    items:
      - const: qcom,msm-watchdog

  reg:
    minItems: 1

  reg-names:
    items:
      - const: wdt-base
      - const: wdt-absent-base
    minItems: 1

  interrupts:
    minItems: 2
    maxItems: 2

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
  - reg-names
  - interrupts

additionalProperites: false

example:
  - |
    wdog: qcom,wdt@17c10000{
	compatible = "qcom,msm-watchdog";
	reg = <0x17c10000 0x1000>;
	reg-names = "wdt-base";
	interrupts = <0 0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                <0 1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
    };
