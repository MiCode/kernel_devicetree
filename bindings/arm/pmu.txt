* ARM Performance Monitor Units
ARM cores often have a PMU for counting cpu and cache events like cache misses
and hits. The interface to the PMU is part of the ARM ARM. The ARM PMU
representation in the device tree should be done as under:-

Required properties:
- compatible : should be one of
		"arm,armv8-pmuv3"
		
- interrupts : 1 combined interrupt or 1 per core. If the interrupt is a per-cpu
		interrupt (PPI) then 1 interrupt should be specified.
		
Optional properties:

- qcom,no-pc-write : Indicates that this PMU doesn't support the 0xc and 0xd
events.

Example:

pmu {
	compatible = "arm,armv8-pmu3";
	interrupts = <GIC_PPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
