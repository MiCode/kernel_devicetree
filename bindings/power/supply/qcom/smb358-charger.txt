Summit smb358 battery charger

SMB358 is a single-cell battery charger. It can charge
the battery and power the system via the USB/AC adapter input.

The smb358 interface is via I2C bus.

Required Properties:
- compatible			Must be "qcom,smb358-charger".
- reg				The device 7-bit I2C address.
- interrupt-parent		parent of interrupt.
- interrupts			This indicates the IRQ number of the GPIO
				connected to the STAT pin.
- qcom,irq-gpio			GPIO which receives interrupts from STAT output.
- qcom,bms-psy-name		This is a string and it points to the bms
				power supply name.
- qcom,float-voltage-mv		Float Voltage in mV - the maximum voltage up to which
				the battery is charged. Supported range 3500mV to 4500mV

Optional Properties:

- qcom,fastchg-current-max-ma	Fast Charging current in mA. Supported range is
				from 200mA to 2000mA.
- qcom,chg-valid-gpio		GPIO which indicates the charger presence.
				This GPIO is connected to the SYSOK pin.
- qcom,chg-autonomous-mode	This is a bool property and it indicates that the
				charger is configured for autonomous operation and
				does not require any software configuration.
- qcom,disable-apsd		This is a bool property which disables automatic
				power source detection (APSD). If this is set
				charger detection is done by DCIN UV irq.
- qcom,charger-disabled		This is a bool property which disables charging.
- qcom,using-pmic-therm		This property indicates thermal pin connected to pmic or smb.
- qcom,vcc-i2c-supply           Power source required to power up i2c bus.
- qcom,bms-controlled-charging	This property indicates integrating with VMBMS, charger
				driver and BMS communicates with each other via power_supply
				framework. Property "qcom,iterm-disabled" also needs defined
				if using this feature to make sure that the charger doesn't
				terminate charging on its own.
- qcom,iterm-ma			Specifies the termination current to indicate end-of-charge.
				Possible values in mA - 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 125, 150, 200.
- qcom,iterm-disabled		Disables the termination current feature. This is a bool
				property.
- qcom,recharge-mv		Recharge threshold in mV - the offset from the float-volatge
				as which the charger restarts charging. Possible
				values are 50mV to 300mV.
- qcom,recharge-disabled	Boolean value which disables the auto-recharge.
- qcom,chg-inhibit-disabled	This is a bool property which disables charger inhibit.
				Charger inhibit option prevents battery charging upon insertion
				of the charger when battery voltage is above the programmed inhibit
				threshold.
- qcom,chg-adc_tm		phandle to the corresponding VADC device to read the ADC channels.
- qcom,cold-bat-decidegc	Cold battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,hot-bat-decidegc		Hot battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,bat-present-decidegc	This is a property indicating battery present temperature, if
				higher than it, battery should exist. Default value is negative,
				if this property is 200, it stands for -200 decidegC.
- qcom,warm-bat-decidegc:	Warm battery temperature in decidegC. After hitting this threshold,
				"qcom,warm-bat-ma" defines maximum charging current and
				"qcom,warm-bat-mv" defines maximum target voltage.
- qcom,cool-bat-decidegc:       Cool battery temperature in decidegC. After hitting this threshold,
				"qcom,cool-bat-ma" defines maximum charging current and
				"qcom,cool-bat-mv" defines maximum target voltage.
- qcom,warm-bat-ma:		Maximum warm battery charge current in milli-amps.
- qcom,cool-bat-ma:		Maximum cool battery charge current in milli-amps.
- qcom,warm-bat-mv:		Maximum warm battery target voltage in milli-volts.
- qcom,cool-bat-mv:		Maximum cool battery target voltage in milli-volts.
- qcom,chg-vadc			Corresponding VADC device's phandle.
- qcom,skip-usb-suspend-for-fake-battery:	A boolean property to skip suspending USB path for fake
				battery. If this property is not present then 'qcom,batt-id-vref-uv' and
				'qcom,batt-id-rpullup-kohm' should be present.
- qcom,batt-id-vref-uv		The reference voltage on the battery-ID line
				specified in micro-volts.
- qcom,batt-id-rpullup-kohm	The pull-up resistor connected on the battery-ID
				(vref) line.
- qcom,using-vbat-sns		Bool property to indicate that VBAT sense can be
				done by PMIC.
