* Qcom virtual gPTP Data based shared memory IPC

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain the core compatibility string
              and the SoC compatibility string. The SoC
              compatibility string is to handle SoC specific
              hardware differences.
              Core compatibility string:
                 "qcom,ptp_virtual"
- reg: address and length of the shared memory for gPTP data

Example:

ptp_virtual {
	compatible = "qcom,ptp_virtual";
	reg = <0xeb600000 0x1000>;
};
