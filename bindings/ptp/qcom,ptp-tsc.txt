* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Timestamp Counter(TSC) based PTP clock

TSC module is a timestamp generator, which runs a 64 bit counter for
system timekeeping.
ETU is event timestamp module, which captures the timestamp from TSC
and global counter bus for a given event. The event is selected from
a set of GPIOs and SW triggered events. The design is parameterized
to detect multiple events, using different “slices”.
One slice is used for every event.

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain the compatibility string.
                 "qcom,tsc"
- reg: address and length of the TSC registers.
	Address and length of the ETU registers(optional).
- reg-names: must contain "tsc", "etu" (optional).
- clocks: list of clock phandles required to access TSC/ETU.
- clock-names: list of clock names for the above clock phandles.
- assigned-clocks: clock phandles to assign clock rates.
- assigned-clock-rates: clock rates in HZ.

Optional properties:
- qcom,tsc-nsec-update: boolean property to indicate the TSC counters
			have values in nanoseconds, rather than in secs
			and nanoseconds.
- qcom,tsc-hw-preload: boolean property to indicate the TSC supports
		the hw preload feature.
- qcom,etu-slice: array of ETU slice numbers corresponding to the ETU sel.
		In case this property is not defined the sel number will be
		considered as the slice number for ETU offset calculation.
- qcom,etu-event-sel: array of ETU event sel numbers for the corresponding
			ETU slice numbers.
- qcom,etu-event-names: ETU event sel names for the corresponding
			event sel numbers.
- interrupts: interrupt numbers associated with the ETU slice.
- interrupt-names: names corresponding to the above interrupt numbers.
- pinctrl-<#> : pinctrl configurations
- pinctrl-names: pinctrl names

Example:

        tsc@1da0000 {
                compatible = "qcom,tsc";
                reg = <0x1da0000 0x2000>, <0x01db0000 0x10000>;
                reg-names = "tsc", "etu";

                clocks = <&gcc GCC_TSC_CFG_AHB_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_TSC_CNTR_CLK >,
                       <&gcc GCC_TSC_ETU_CLK>;
                clock-names = "cfg_ahb", "cntr", "etu";
                assigned-clocks = <&gcc GCC_TSC_CNTR_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_TSC_ETU_CLK>;
                assigned-clock-rates = <500000000> , <500000000>;

		qcom,etu-slice = <1 5>;
		qcom,etu-event-sel = <1 3>;
		qcom,etu-event-names = "gps_pps", "tod_pps";

	        interrupts = <GIC_SPI 331 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
                             <GIC_SPI 329 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
                interrupt-names = "tod_pps", "gps_pps";

		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&etu_tod_pps_active>, <&etu_gps_pps_active>;
        };
